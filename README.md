# Quantum_Computing
A quantum computer simulator built using python.
Contains the following quantum gates:
- Hadamard gate
- Phase shift gate (Pauli-Z)
- NOT gate (Pauli-X)
- Rotation gate
- Controlled NOT gate
- Controlled phase shift gate

Simulates the following algorithms:
- Grover's quantum search algorithm
- Shor's factoring algorithm
- Mermin's quantum device

The same circuits and algorithms are also implemented using IBM's Qiskit for comparison
